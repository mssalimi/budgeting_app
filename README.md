Program checks if the user exceeds the budget and shows the results of expenditures as percentages for each category (food & beverages, entertainment, apparel and so on).

2. What can be given as an input?

3. What is the desired output?
The output will be the expenditure categories with percentages and informative message that tells if the user exceeded the budget or not.

4. Where to use functions?
Functions can be used for defining the percentage for each expenditure category. 

5. Where to use a loop (for/while)?
On consolidation of  expenses by categories
List of expenses and categories
6. Where to use if-else?
The if-else can be used for the checking budget limit if the user exceeds the limit set. 

7. How to check if the user input is correct and what will happen if it is not?
Try-expect can be used to check if the user entered the right format for the input. The program can prevent the user from entering string instead of float.
